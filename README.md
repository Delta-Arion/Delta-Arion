- 👋 Hi, I’m @Delta-Arion
- 👀 I’m interested in Programming and Computers, duh....
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, Python, Java, C, JS and C#; I love Java and python though
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Open projects that involve mathematical calculations.
- 📫 How to reach me: I prefer to stay anonymous.
- 😄 Pronouns: He
- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that Python isn't actually named after the snake; it was named after Monty Python LOL
- Programming jokes: Do you know why programmers where specks? Cause they can't C sharp! LOL (If you didn't understand, it's C#)
- Another joke: Do you know why programmers prefer dark mode to light mode? Cause light attracts BUGS! lol
